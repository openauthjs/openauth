# Code of Conduct

I don't typically set up a code of conduct for our projects but given this one is security related it will draw a very specific set of problems I want to avoid. There's only two rules

1. Reporting security issues

If you find a security issue please report them to me directly on [X](https://twitter.com/thdxr) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/). Do not open a public issue or post publicly in case the issue can be exploited. Feel free to give us a window of time to respond before disclosing it publicly - that seems fair.

2. Reporting "security" issues

A lot of things that seem to fall in that first category are not really security problems, just tradeoffs that were made in the design of OpenAuth. Security products attract a lot of binary opinions like "never use X". We reject this type of thinking entirely - security is a spectrum of usability and infinitely optimizing for "security" does not yield a good product.

All discussions around the tradeoffs that were made must consider this - if you disagree with a decision you MUST articulate why the decision was probably made before you argue against it. Eg. "X seem to be used because of benefit [a] and their downside [b] is mitigated by [c] BUT I do not think this is enough because of [d]"

We do not tolerate wasting the maintainers time and forcing them to articulate this nuance. If something is not clear of course you can ask for clarification.
